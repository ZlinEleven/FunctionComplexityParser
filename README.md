Homework #3 for my CSE214 class. The purpose of the project is to create an application that specifically takes in a python file containing a 
function and returns the time complexity in big-Oh notation. The restrictions being that the program will only read the first function in the 
file and operations and keywords are limited

What I learned:
 - How to read a file using scanner
 - The stack data structure
